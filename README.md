This package contains methods to simulate a renewal-equation
structured-population branching process in R for modelling infectious
disease outbreaks. That is, a branching process where the population is
structured into groups (e.g.Â age, workplace type, vaccination status),
and where the process evolves over time in calendar days.

This is very much a work in process.
