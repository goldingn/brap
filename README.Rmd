# brap

This package contains methods to simulate a renewal-equation structured-population branching process in R for modelling infectious disease outbreaks. That is, a branching process where the population is structured into groups (e.g. age, workplace type, vaccination status), and where the process evolves over time in calendar days.

This is very much a work in process.

## Installation

You can install the development version of brap from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("goldingn/brap")
```
