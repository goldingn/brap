# structured branching process simulation in R

This package contains methods to simulate a renewal-equation structured-population branching process in R for modelling infectious disease outbreaks. That is, a branching process where the population is structured into groups (e.g. age, workplace type, vaccination status), and where the process evolves over time in calendar days.

This is very much a work in process.
